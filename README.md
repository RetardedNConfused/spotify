# Coachella Match

Streamlit app to help match your Spotify history with the bands coming to Coachella 2023. The app is pretty simple and just reads in your Spotify history data and matches it with the Coachella line up. It then filters, adds a few features, and plots it all into a nice looking chart. 

# Usage

Clone the repo and install the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you can run the app
`streamlit run coachella_match.py`
